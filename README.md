# Rust Snake Game with A* Pathfinding

This is a Snake game implemented in Rust using the SDL2 library for graphics and A* algorithm for finding the shortest path to the food.

## Getting Started

## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- Press `C` and the snake will automatically find the shortest path to the food using the A* algorithm.


## Tasks
- [ ] Add levels of increasing difficulty.
